quasiquoter: syntax that is specific to ghc haskell
gets translated into haskell code

G2Q interface
we have some kind of condition we want to be true
not very flexible
somewhat non composable

match function and solution function

SMTEN (detailed) VS G2Q (specific)

goal:
combine both

data Sym a =
Sym a = symbolic a

f::Int -> Maybe Int
 we want to change this to

 Out: Sym Int

to do that:

f::Int->Sym Int -> Sym Int

 all::Sym a
empty:: Sym a
single::a -> Sym a
union::Sym a -> Sym a -> Sym a



for code:-
all based on g2
revise haskell
readings
Lazy Counterfactual Symbolic execution
install and be able to run g2
pull repository from github and run using cabal

File Quasiquoter
